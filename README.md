import sense of humour


- 👋 Hi, I’m @emanlaerton Im residing in Australia and have an absolute minimum education, sometimes I wonder why or how I've made it this far in life.
- 👀 I’m interested in a career in coding (python for now then one of the C's I really don't know where to start but I know I must Start) and maybe finding some learned friends along the way.
- 🌱 I’m a beginner in Python currently learning RegEx's its a headnick but I am getting there. # a headnick means the data is feeling corrupted lol
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much at the moment if anything it would have to be so basic I'm sure an app could do it.
- 📫 How to reach me This one is a hard one because I'm a really private person so it's not like I'm going to hand out one of my emails. Perhaps push me pull me
